# Arduino_Security Intruder Alarm System_Project

In this project, we are going to make a Door Security Intruder Alarm System using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. The ultrasonic sensor used in this project is used as a distance sensor, it will tell us the distance at which the object is placed. Using this distance value, we will turn the buzzer on or off.
here i provided Tinkercad link for the connections and also you can verify above .ino code and screenshot.
